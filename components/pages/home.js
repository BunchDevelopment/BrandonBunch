        <p class="col-blog-post">3 years ago, I was trying to really find a career. I called my brother and asked him what he enjoyed about being a developer. His response was that it was constantly challenging to him. To me, this was the best answer. I mean, how could a person who has done this job for over 5 years, still be challenged? As a person, I tend to get really bored when I don't challenge myself. I was interested. He recommended I try out the CS50 course on iTunes. It was the same exact course he took when he was learning, just updated because things change. After my first bug which took 3 days to figure out, and was dumbfounded when it was a missing semi colon, I was in love with programming. The rush of satisfaction from finally figuring out the bug that has wrecked my thought process for over 48 hours, was finally fixed! Since then, I have been hooked.</p>

        <p class="col-blog-post">Well, I am a simple man who enjoys simple things. Basically everything technology. I am a firm believer that technologies sole purpose, is to improve your life. I tend to spend my time playing video games, browsing random things on my computer, going deep down the rabbit holes in YouTube, and the occasional outing with the friends. See? Simple man who loves simple things.</p>
